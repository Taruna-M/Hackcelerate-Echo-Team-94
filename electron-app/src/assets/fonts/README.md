# Fonts Directory

This directory contains font files used by the application.

For development, the application will fall back to system fonts if the custom fonts are not available.

## Recommended Fonts

- **Fira Code**: A monospace font with programming ligatures
- **Consolas**: A good alternative monospace font available on Windows
- **Monaco**: A good alternative monospace font available on macOS

In production, you should include the actual font files in this directory.
